# XMROnline-Kernel（门罗在线-矿工/门罗在线，内核）
OnlineGoldMining is a Monero online and Monero online-miner kernel developed based on XMRig. It is a high-performance, open source, cross-platform unified CPU/GPU miner and RandomX benchmark for RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight, AstroBWT and GhostRider. Official binaries are available for Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

## Mining backends
 * CPU (x64/ARMv7/ARMv8)
 * OpenCL for AMD GPUs.
 * CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs.

## Download
 * [Binary releases](https://github.com/XMR-Online/XMROnline-Kernel/releases)
 * [Official website download](https://xmr-online.github.io/#Download)

## Usage
The preferred way to configure the miner is to directly open it and enter the relevant data according to the prompts, because it is more flexible and intuitive. For example, directly selecting mining with different algorithms can be done by directly selecting options, and changing important options does not require restarting the miner.
